# Trello to SQL

Well, this is pretty straight forward. This web application will access your Trello board and then create a local MS SQL database with all your boards, lists, cards and their actions. This makes reporting a breeze. You can calculate the duration of a card in a list, resources assigned etc.

**Get a Trello API key:**

Proceed to the below link to get an API Key from Trello:

[https://trello.com/app-key/](https://trello.com/app-key/)

##IMPORTANT:##

Insert the the API key in the web.config file as well as the secret key generated by Trello.
Next, open the "trello.js" file and insert your API key there as well.

**Setup the IIS entry:**

Download the source code and create the web application in your IIS management tool. Make sure the web application is working correctly by browsing to it. You should see the first image below:

**Running the application:**

Now you need to create the database using the script provided:

You also need to then give permissions to the application to access your Trello board:

OK, you are ready... as soon as you run the application you should see (holding thumbs) the folders piling up in the output folder:
