We have noticed that capturers are placing a lot of matters on hold, and I have reason to believe that not all of them should be placed on hold, it would also be good for that special verification queue to be able to make amends to plaintiff and defendant details, that include adding or removing them. This is so that everything that is re-worked in this queue should not be returned to capturers but rather be placed on hold if itâ€™s a genuine on hold. We had a similar exercise in 2012 were we had a verifier re-work all the on hold matters and over 50% went through to the clients.","descData":null,"idBoard":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411","idList":"548561d74df012abdef092c7","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":8,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["5524c304664ce8ff3000ff49"],"name":"CW - GCCW080 - On hold matters","pos":204799,"shortLink":"voX3dsrV","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":4,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+54362fd540c015bf7e38a78c+1e278e68c6e524e5e2a9f085c2bc77736c2bf5fa@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["53d097f91cb25024461e3efd"],"labels":[{"id":"5524c304664ce8ff3000ff49","idBoard":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411","name":"Enhancement","color":"green","uses":30}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/voX3dsrV","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/voX3dsrV/8-cw-gccw080-on-hold-matters"}
