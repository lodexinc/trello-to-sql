I need to spec a change to add â€œPaid up letterâ€ as a new reason on the system linked to wherever a rescission is a reason, for instance, judgment by default, judgment by consent etc.\n\nI have spoken to dev and I require them to do a cursory investigation into what exactly need to be changed in the system to add this new reason. Once I have the go ahead and any information that they can provide, I can generate the spec document for the enhancement.\n\nNB: This enhancement can also not go live until the bureaus have made the necessary changes to their systems to accommodate the new reason.\n","descData":null,"idBoard":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411","idList":"548561d74df012abdef092c7","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":31,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["5524c304664ce8ff3000ff49"],"name":"CW - CCW273 - Paid up Letter enhancement","pos":1359871,"shortLink":"ulydKjnw","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":3,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+54d1d1eff91836559223a208+963b88d8b4edcb7561c40bfb958b6fb0f02832e2@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"5524c304664ce8ff3000ff49","idBoard":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411","name":"Enhancement","color":"green","uses":30}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/ulydKjnw","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/ulydKjnw/31-cw-ccw273-paid-up-letter-enhancement"}
