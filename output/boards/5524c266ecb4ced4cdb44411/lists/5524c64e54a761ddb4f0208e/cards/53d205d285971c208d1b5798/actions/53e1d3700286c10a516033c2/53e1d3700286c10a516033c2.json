The Questionable Documents is available to test on v2.courtworks.co.za\n\nThere is one problem however. The current \"Case Editor\" caters for documents that is already captured/verified. Currently the questionable documents will open the case editor, and the case will be available for edit only if the first capturer actually captured the case, and it was put on hold by the second capturer. The case editor is working from XML and if the first capturer place a document on hold, there is no XML available in the Database at that stage."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-06T07:04:16.727Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
