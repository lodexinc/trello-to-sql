The QD section isn\u0027t divided up into different scenarios. I should click on QD and then have the option to work on On Hold matters where the 2nd capturer has placed on hold or another scenario etc.\n2. Please confirm that should a case be verified or placed on hold and match any of the listed scenarios, that it will not go to the bureaus?\n3. Please confirm that after a case has been edited in the QD section, it will then go to the bureaus in the next extraction?\n\nIf you would like to discuss this enhancement please come chat."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-14T07:30:40.531Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
