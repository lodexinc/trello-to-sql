If that cause is server side then the correct people need to look into it.\n\nIt is happening to 4 agents at the moment:\n\n1.\tKoba Blignaut\n2.\tJossie Wiggill\n3.\tHassan Amod\n4.\tBrian Van Rooyen\n\nAlso, Gordon also had timeouts and that was from a server upstairs in our server room here so it is doubtful that it is client application or internet side."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-06-25T08:12:18.863Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
