JHB just provided me with the link to this service. I am not sure if this is the same one we use to get the daily admin order data from them. \n\nhttp://cdms.lawcredit.co.za/cdmswebmethods/service.asmx\n\nThere are two methods in there that should return the images to us\n\nDocumentGetImages and DocumentGetImagesForBureauApp. Could you please have a look and see if this would be sufficient, otherwise we can get in contact with Heron to make changes.\n\nThanks"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-02-05T09:15:41.589Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
