However, they would now like to know the possibility and possible issues relating to putting the passport number in the ID number field when a passport number exists and the ID number does not exist? If you don\u0027t foresee any issues, a separate log will be submitted for this as Experian\u0027s dev will need to make changes on their side as well."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-10-01T10:07:20.244Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
