The excel sheet provided from yasser states in the first column when this record went out to Experian. It\u0027s called Date Extracted to Experian.\n\nI also went to check the very first record in that spreadsheet, and it did indeed go out  in the file called Recession_Data_20140816_01.txt\n\nIf the issue is with the Passport Number not showing on the document, it is something completely different, as this was not part of the original request from Experian, and will have to be developed and tested on both our side and Experian\u0027s side\n\nThanx\n\n@yasserogier ","card":{"id":"5423cfc7fa26a2bc27eb6f94","name":"CW - CCW237 - No extracting judgments with passport numbers","idShort":230,"shortLink":"udY4ZTBU"},"board":{"name":"Investigation","id":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411"},"list":{"id":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca50a","name":"All Tasks"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-09-25T09:00:18.020Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
