They create it seperately and there\u0027s no way I\u0027d know if it\u0027s linked. So I would\u0027ve created a new log regarding their findings. This however is obviously not complete as they haven\u0027t tested thoroughly or havent advised me that testing is complete."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-11-27T07:41:35.047Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Gillian Oberholzer","initials":"GO","username":"gillianoberholzer"}}
