They wanted to know how to determine old vs new system so I explained the appending of the 1| or the 0| before the Image ID.\n\nThey then asked how can they know if the case is old or new system. So I thought we could give them a list of IDs with Case Numbers and Courts from the old system data so that they can match it up.\n\nThen this morning their CTO called me and he is very angry that our API is providing them with incorrect imaged regarding of what is appended to the image ID. \n\nThey searched on the API using the following Reg Numbers and then used the resulting Image IDs to get the images which were received as incorrect.\n\n1985/007115/23\n2004/022186/23\n1985/007115/23\n2005/001397/06\n2007/024709/07\n2007/024709/07\n\nTherefore, please could you do the following:\n\n1.\tPlease investigate why/how we are supplying them with incorrect images?\n2.\tPlease provide a data extract showing the old system ID for them to use for image searches as well as including the case number, court and company reg number so that they can differentiate between old and new system and then amend their data to have the 1| before all the image IDs. This is for commercial data only. i.e. Company judgments.\n\nFor 2 data extract, columns are ImageID, Case Number, Court, Court Type, Company Reg Number.\n","descData":null,"idBoard":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411","idList":"5524c64e54a761ddb4f0208e","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":146,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["5524c403664ce8ff30010321","5524c406664ce8ff30010331"],"name":"CW - CCW363 - Inoxico Incorrect images via API","pos":229408.90625,"shortLink":"tZOIs1AN","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":13,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+55d580717c9d7d0f04f3ac97+7510cf080dcf25036eca3af01cd9cd94c513d7a0@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"5524c403664ce8ff30010321","idBoard":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411","name":"Issue / Bug","color":"blue","uses":31},{"id":"5524c406664ce8ff30010331","idBoard":"5524c266ecb4ced4cdb44411","name":"Business Critical","color":"red","uses":4}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/tZOIs1AN","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/tZOIs1AN/146-cw-ccw363-inoxico-incorrect-images-via-api"}
