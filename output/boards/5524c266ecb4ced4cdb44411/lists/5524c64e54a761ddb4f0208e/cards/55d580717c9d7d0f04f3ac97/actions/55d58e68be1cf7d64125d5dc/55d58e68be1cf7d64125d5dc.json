The \"Piped\" Value being returned from the API for each Reg Number.\n2. The \"FAX ID\" Value being passed back for each Reg Number to get the images\n3. The Image Paths being returned for each Reg Number.\n\n\nPS - I have been in contact with a Developer by the name of Addworks a while back to help him fix why their images were not pulling back. His issue was that he was stripping off the piped value  (0 or 1) and only passing in the remainding FAXID which was causing their initial image issue. That issue was fixed at that point when he started using the \"FULL PIPED FAXID\" that we provide.\n\n@cobuspienaar @stefanbar @jakovanrensburg @willemhuman"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-08-20T08:23:04.899Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfc3dbf80a9a2e4631c72c","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Yasser Ogier","initials":"YO","username":"yasserogier"}}
