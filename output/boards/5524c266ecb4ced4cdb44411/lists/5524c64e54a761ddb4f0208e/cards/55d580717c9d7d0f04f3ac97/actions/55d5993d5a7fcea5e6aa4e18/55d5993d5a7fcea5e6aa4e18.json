The issue arises because we only have the OldId value stored in our database (for pre- July 2013 judgements) â€“ for new judgements we are storing the FaxID field and can therefore get the correct images.\n\nThis is why we were originally requesting either:\n1.\tAn extract of new vs old refs so that we update our database with new refs (FaxID) (for older judgements). An alternative would be to hit your API and get the (new) FaxID for each reg number before getting images (but there would obvisously be cost implications involved)\n2.\tA workaround for accessing images using the OldId (this is where I thought you said prefixing with â€œ1|â€ would work).\"\n\n@gillianoberholzer @cobuspienaar @stefanbar @jakovanrensburg @willemhuman"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-08-20T09:09:17.630Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
