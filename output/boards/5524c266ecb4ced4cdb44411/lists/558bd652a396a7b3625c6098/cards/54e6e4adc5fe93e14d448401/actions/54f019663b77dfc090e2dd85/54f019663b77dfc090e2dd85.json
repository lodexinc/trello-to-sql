I am a bit confused here. Have you checked if the flag is there or not? Or do you want dev to go and investigate? Surely it must only come through to dev if the DR flag is not included on the report and a change is actually required. Based on the above description,it states that the change must only be made if the status is not already included. \n\nCould you also please send us the original log as mentioned above, as none of us are able to find it in our emails. \n\nI have emailed the Current Report to both yourself and shaun. If you could please indicate from there what it is you are looking for or what we should change I would appreciate it. \n\nThanks\n\n@shaunviljoen @willemhuman @yasserogier @lylenutt"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-02-27T07:14:46.499Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
