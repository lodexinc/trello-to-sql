I just read through the whole email between shaun and neil. I am still not convinced that this is a Development issue yet. Has anyone investigated if the field is on the report or not? Either support or Operations must please go and investigate fisrt and check if the field is on the report. If not there, this can be escalated to dev in order to add to the report please.\n\nThanks\n\n@willemhuman @yasserogier @stefanbar"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-03T08:58:20.682Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
