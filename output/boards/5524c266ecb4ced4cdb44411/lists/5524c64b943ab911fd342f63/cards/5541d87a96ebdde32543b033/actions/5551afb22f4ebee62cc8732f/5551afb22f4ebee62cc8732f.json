They don\u0027t have a specific Property History Module, only Deeds Data, maybe I am missing it. I wonder if they supply it with their offline DB? Then it will be cheaper.... Please can you find out more details? Maybe show them a Property History report and ask them if they can provide only that information? Then we can swap over."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-05-12T07:45:54.007Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3","avatarHash":"f303f406818d7519d91c3c089e1c27a8","fullName":"Jako van Rensburg","initials":"JR","username":"jakovanrensburg"}}
