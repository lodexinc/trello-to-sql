Not our data and we certainly don\u0027t fiddle with it - we use as is.\n\nWe work on an API basis with Deeds Office - we will never be 100% the same, as they are the data source and are able to manipulate what they return to consumer.\n\nThe fact is - the property exist on both Deeds Offices because it WAS registered in the PTA deeds office initially.
