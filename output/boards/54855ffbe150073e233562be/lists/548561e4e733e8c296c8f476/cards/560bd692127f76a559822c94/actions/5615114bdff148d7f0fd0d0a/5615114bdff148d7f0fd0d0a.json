Only load a portion of the images regardless of how many total images are assigned to a case. 10 or maybe 20. As the user moves through the pages, more images can load in the background. For instance, when the user gets to around 18/20, load the next 20.\n2. Show the amount of pages on the screen near the capture counter.\n3. If there is more than 300 pages in a case, popup a box that the capturer has to click to remove and continue stating that there is a large number of pages, please check if the document needs to be split.\n4. Add a new on hold reason called, Bulk Image Split.\n5. The new solution to split images on large cases then can be used to split these cases.\n\n@gillianoberholzer "},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-10-07T12:34:19.838Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
