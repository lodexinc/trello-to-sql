If the user belongs to the group called Bridging and we enable a type it will not enable for them. Same goes for Credit ones.... I don\u0027t know. This is a tricky one. You want the new types to be available to clients, except for Credit ones. Having groups might help, but then, it might also change again where some of those group users need access. Then it\u0027s a manual process, again."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-04-01T09:18:11.666Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3","avatarHash":"f303f406818d7519d91c3c089e1c27a8","fullName":"Jako van Rensburg","initials":"JR","username":"jakovanrensburg"}}
