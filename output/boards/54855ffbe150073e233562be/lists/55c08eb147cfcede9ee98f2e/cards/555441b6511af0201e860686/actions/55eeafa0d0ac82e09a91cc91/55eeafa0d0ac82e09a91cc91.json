The transparency related to this implementation was not 100% clear. I eventually had to ask the question of whether we should be testing this with a email from Stef on the 31st (please include Gill in your testing emails as well as i might miss this). Therefore, this call was lying with me and not Gill. In general, lets please keep the requests concise and clear via Trello and not emails as per Jako\u0027s initial requests."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-09-08T09:51:28.653Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53db26ef44764d14b1c49249","avatarHash":"2f66ac51e8ff606990044d4c58638506","fullName":"Shaun Viljoen","initials":"SV","username":"shaunviljoen"}}
