The fields that need to be captured are in the attached field list.\n\nâ€¢\tOnly Maintenance and Maintenance Substitution Orders need to be fast captured this way. Please exclude Divorce Orders.\nâ€¢\tThese fast captured data fields need to be available for searching upon by the as well as for reporting purposes in terms of the total amount verified/captured etc.\nâ€¢\tThe fast capture process must be a single capture, single verify process.\nâ€¢\tThe auto-sorter should provide the work to both processes at the time of sorting.\nâ€¢\tA unique reference number should be assigned at the time of sorting so that the two processes can be linked up at the end when the two data records reach the Index 360 company.\nâ€¢\tA new front end will need to be created as well as a new database to store this data.\nâ€¢\tAll fields can be on one screen as there are not enough to warrant separating them.\nâ€¢\tTwo new roles need to be created in client central called:\no\tIndex 360 Fast Capturer\no\tIndex 360 Fast Verifier\nâ€¢\tThese roles should only have access to the fast capture system.\nâ€¢\tThe Status Report should be updated to show, in addition to the current figures:\no\tHow many fast captured per month\no\tHow many fast captured all time\no\tHow many fast verified per month\no\tHow many fast verified all time\nâ€¢\tThe Capturer Invoice Index 360 report needs to include:\no\tMaintenance Orders Fast Captured\no\tMaintenance Orders Fast Verified\no\tMaintenance Orders Fast On Hold\no\tMaintenance Substitution Orders Fast Captured\no\tMaintenance Substitution Orders Fast Verified\no\tMaintenance Substitution Orders Fast On Hold\n\nIf you have any further questions please let me know.
