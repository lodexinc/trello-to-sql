Unfortunately the reviewer has no option other than to capture the case. We have also found that some cases have very bad quality images and are being put on review.\n\nPlease can we have two buttons for the reviewer:\n\n1.\tA button to place the case on hold for bad quality images. This will allow us to report on the agents who are taking bad quality images. The case must then be removed from the review list.\n2.\tA button to place the case back into the capturing queue. This will allow the reviewer to send the case back to the capturing queue as it should be able to be captured. The case must then be removed from the review list. \n\nIf there are questions on this, please let me know.\n","descData":null,"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"55c08eb147cfcede9ee98f2e","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":475,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["54855ffb74d650d567b90183","548561a179d5c1de96ba5276"],"name":"CW - CCW354 - New buttons in review section for MBOD","pos":6.5625,"shortLink":"t9bHqGZS","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":9,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+55b0ea9ca001a6857c754092+5f69615d8b221c05bbbc34e4df0ca4baa75f2d9e@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90183","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Enhancement","color":"green","uses":139},{"id":"548561a179d5c1de96ba5276","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Urgent","color":"orange","uses":199}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/t9bHqGZS","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/t9bHqGZS/475-cw-ccw354-new-buttons-in-review-section-for-mbod"}
