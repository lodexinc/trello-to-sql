The main folder showing the agent\u0027s name is red and bold depicting that there is work to sort in that folder but only one of the folders actually has work in it so it is showing red and bold but has nothing in it. It would be preferable to show red and bold only if there is actual files somewhere in the tree of that folder.\n2. Can the sub folders such as Judgments and Debt Review Order as well as the Month folders show an indication of there being files in that sub tree as well?\n\nThe above will assist in reducing the time needed to find work that needs to be sorted instead of going through 100s of folders."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-09-25T08:24:54.460Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
