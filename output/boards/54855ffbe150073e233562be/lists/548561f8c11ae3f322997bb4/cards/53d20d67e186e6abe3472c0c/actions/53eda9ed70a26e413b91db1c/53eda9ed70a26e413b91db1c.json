I notice that the quality of the images being uploaded is very bad. e.g. there is currently 831 images in Nico Campher\u0027s folder, with barcodes, but the Autosorter cannot sort this, and doesn\u0027t even pick up that there is a barcode because of bad image quality. If we can get the UA\u0027s to improve the quality of their images, it will help a lot, as the Autosorter will then handle it"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-15T06:34:21.024Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
