Surely this must be possible. Our CIPC documents section under the document manager displays all outstanding Docs. So all we require is for that list to be exported (which we can do) bit with 2 fields added being the Document type (like a CK1 or 2), and whether the client has flagged it as certified. If you click on each request as can be seen in the below pic, it provides all that info related to that specific document so we just required that in the export list as well."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-06-02T06:58:56.351Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53db26ef44764d14b1c49249","avatarHash":"2f66ac51e8ff606990044d4c58638506","fullName":"Shaun Viljoen","initials":"SV","username":"shaunviljoen"}}
