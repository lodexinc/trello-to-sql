It\u0027s when we added the Excel History export. What happens is the method building the history HTML is determining which order by to use based on the ID. It then assigns the order by text and sends it to the dataset method to retrieve the data. What then happens is on the dataset method it also tries to determine which order by to use then it Defaults since the order by is not a number but already the Text.\n\nJust remove the switch statement in the History.cs file that determines which order by to use. On the BuildHistoryList method on line 31.
