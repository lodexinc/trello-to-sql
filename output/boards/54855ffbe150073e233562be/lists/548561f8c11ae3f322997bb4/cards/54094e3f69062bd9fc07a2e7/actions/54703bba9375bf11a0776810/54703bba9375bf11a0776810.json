I think only an owner of the item should be allowed to password protect it and not allow someone to password protect items that have been shared with them. So a protected item will have no actions available until they enter the correct password. My only concerns is how are we going to handle if someone forgets the password they used to protect the item, we will have to be smart about this not to open security loop holes. Any ideas perhaps from your side?"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-11-22T07:31:06.950Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbd67fd63aac7f152189c","avatarHash":"c4073941033c6263ed206ed19771873b","fullName":"Stefan Bar","initials":"SB","username":"stefanbar"}}
