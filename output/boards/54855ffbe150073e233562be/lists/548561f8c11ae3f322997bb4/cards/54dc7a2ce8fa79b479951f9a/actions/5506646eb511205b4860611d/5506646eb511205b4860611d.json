I feel that this is enhancements and should be addressed separately from the initial specification. We are currently wasting a lot of time and resources on this, which is adding a lot of pressure on the Government Gazettes Project. I think if initial development is done according to spec, and tested based on that, this can go live, and enhancements can be addressed later. Just my opinion."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-16T05:04:46.882Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
