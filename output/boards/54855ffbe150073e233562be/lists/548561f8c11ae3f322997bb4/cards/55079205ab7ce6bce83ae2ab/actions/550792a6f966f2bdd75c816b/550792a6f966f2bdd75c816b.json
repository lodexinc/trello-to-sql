That request has been sitting there since the 13th of March. It won\u0027t continue if the request is stuck. I did put code in place to delete the file if the User Token of the request is invalid but something is not right. I think we may need to update the web reference of the Bulk Service since we\u0027ve added a new search type. Please just refresh the web services, update the DLL\u0027s to the latest and just scan the code and see if there might be some bug causing this. Thanks guys!"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-17T02:34:14.418Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3","avatarHash":"f303f406818d7519d91c3c089e1c27a8","fullName":"Jako van Rensburg","initials":"JR","username":"jakovanrensburg"}}
