If it\u0027s a feature, and it\u0027s in testing, it means I still need to test and havent had the chance to as I\u0027m testing other products. If there\u0027s issues picked up it remains in testing and does not move else it wont be tested further. We cannot move a feature in development for every issue picked up and then back to testing after one issue logged every time. We\u0027ve been working this way all along where it remains in testing. Also as with our other products once in testing it then moves to ready to release by me, then release scheduled by Jako / Stefan, etc. If I log an issue and address it to whoever in comments, they attend to it and move to in development if necessary. If somethng goes live, we need to comment on the logs. And get it archived my myself or Jako, etc."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-09T08:39:36.227Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Gillian Oberholzer","initials":"GO","username":"gillianoberholzer"}}
