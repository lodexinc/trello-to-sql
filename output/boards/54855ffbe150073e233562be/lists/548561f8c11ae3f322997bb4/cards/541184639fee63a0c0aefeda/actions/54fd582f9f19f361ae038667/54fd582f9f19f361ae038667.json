I just noticed that there is no feedback on this ticket since the 16th of feb, and I don\u0027t want a scenario again where the list becomes to long. If there is still issues, the cards must go out from In testing and back to development, or new Issues must be logged. The in testing column is to test a feature that was developed/enhanced or fixed earlier. If it is not working, it must go back to one of the other columns, and any issues still not working, or that needs to change must be logged."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-09T08:22:07.002Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
