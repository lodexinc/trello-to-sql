Are you telling me that you are then still testing this exact feature? Surely, you tested this, you found a bug, and it is now not in testing anymore. I agree, dev must move this, and I also agree, Jako would have been the one to move it. We need to know however if we should move it. This is my concern, there was no feedback on this ticket for almost a month. This is a problem from all sides."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-09T08:53:41.058Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
