Where this can become a problem is when i am not here and Lyle needs to continue on the issue he will have no clue where to start and there will be no track or proper explanation of the change as the log does not describe the change. Basically it creates room for arguments about when a change was made or what was requested. \n\nWe mostly come to you to provide us with a date when a change was requested. In this case you will struggle to find the change request. its more a process of being descriptive to make the system useful and a success :smile: \n\ni am currently looking into the issue."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-11T09:06:51.096Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfc3dbf80a9a2e4631c72c","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Yasser Ogier","initials":"YO","username":"yasserogier"}}
