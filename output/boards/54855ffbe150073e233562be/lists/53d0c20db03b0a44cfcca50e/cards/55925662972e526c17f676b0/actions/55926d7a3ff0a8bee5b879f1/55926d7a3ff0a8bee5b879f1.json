The Verifier needs 2 sets of XML to compare. If the Admin guy does all the work then there will only be 1 XML. Then we might as well create a Admin Captuer 1 and Admin Capturer 2 which was never the case initially.\n\nit seems that we will have to cancel the 2nd Capturer from sending to Admin.\n\nI have changed the database a bit to do double checks on records sent to Admin as it was messing with the process.\n\nPlease ask the Verifier to grab a new record so long."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-06-30T10:20:42.375Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfc3dbf80a9a2e4631c72c","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Yasser Ogier","initials":"YO","username":"yasserogier"}}
