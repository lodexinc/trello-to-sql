It should then move to the new request. Please let me know on WhatsApp when another user experiences a delay and I will check if it actually worked. Problem is I cannot even mail them to say they have logged out because I cannot get their details from the database if they have. The ID I have of them is not longer valid. :)"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-01-20T14:08:19.515Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3","avatarHash":"f303f406818d7519d91c3c089e1c27a8","fullName":"Jako van Rensburg","initials":"JR","username":"jakovanrensburg"}}
