The difference would be that this manual sorting would look at a specific list of cases where the number of images are 51 or more. The options to choose and actions performed on the manual sorting of the images should be identical to the current manual sorting. In other words, the user should be presented with the images connected to the specific case and then they should be able to choose the images to be sorted and the agent, doc type and court. Then the selected images need to be inserted into a new case to be put into the queues for capturing as per normal. You might need to consider the unique ref field as well as these cases are not going to be inserted through the autosorter.\n\nAnother idea is to list the cases in a list and allow the user to select the case that they want to work on. The list could also show the number of images.\n\nOne other option that should be available to the user working on these cases is for them to reset it to new and put it back into the queue for normal capturing. This might happen where there is legitimately a case with more than 50 images and it is actually correct.\n\n\nLogged by Neil","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"548561db38fd879b2bc329e5","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":520,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["54855ffb74d650d567b90183"],"name":"CW - CCW361 - Solution to split images on large case","pos":90112,"shortLink":"WXQCRYvO","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":0,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+55cdb4fb493c1e23afd3e449+d6b453e33f86eba431ec2bf1d37d6bf29527678d@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90183","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Enhancement","color":"green","uses":139}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/WXQCRYvO","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/WXQCRYvO/520-cw-ccw361-solution-to-split-images-on-large-case"}
