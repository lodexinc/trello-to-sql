It matches the data perfectly, however when I try and view info on the case that is matched, it does nothing. On further investigation, I noticed that no images are showing up in the case editor on UAT for any of the data that Yasser provided me with. I am unable to test this issue if the images are not there as the whole point is to match images. Please investigate.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"548561db38fd879b2bc329e5","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":148,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["54855ffb74d650d567b90187"],"name":"CW - CCW264 - Match images issue","pos":344064,"shortLink":"Al5zExD5","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":3,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+54c74be99f6949a423471b49+2dd70a79595836c9d6427fa1f476dc6ec10f7de9@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90187","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Issue / Bug","color":"blue","uses":206}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/Al5zExD5","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/Al5zExD5/148-cw-ccw264-match-images-issue"}
