It\u0027s not going to prevent the user from omitting street number. A suggestion from support, maybe have a modal with address confirmation \"Are you sure this is the correct address\". If Address 3 field is required what would the user have filled in there. What if it\u0027s a PO box, e.g. PO Box 1234 Cape Town. What would they fill in for address 3 field."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-25T06:52:17.995Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Gillian Oberholzer","initials":"GO","username":"gillianoberholzer"}}
