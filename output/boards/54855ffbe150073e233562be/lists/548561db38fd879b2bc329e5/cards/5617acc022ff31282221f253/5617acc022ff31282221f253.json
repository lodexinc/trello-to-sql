This would be a single capture with no verification. This would be specifically for only the cases that we currently send to the bureaus, the most urgent being judgments.\n\nOnce captured and saved the system should alert the user if there are previously captured records in the system and give them the option to disable the old records so that the newly captured record is sent to the bureaus at the next extraction. If there is a way to force these captured records to go to the bureaus without disabling the old records then that is fine. As long as they do go to the bureaus.\n\nThe main reason for this is that we have captured a case from the court in the past but it had no ID numbers on the documentation. Then the attorney complains to the bureau that their judgment is not listed. The bureau obtains proper documentation and sends it to us. We insert them into the queue and they are captured but never go to the bureaus.\n\nLogged by Neil","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"548561db38fd879b2bc329e5","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":646,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["54855ffb74d650d567b90183","560b9120dd52582e17b54dc0"],"name":"CW - CCW398 - Provide a way to capture case manually","pos":6145.4375,"shortLink":"FPLsJKh4","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":0,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+5617acc022ff31282221f253+d1831296883df1312da2e1f569e8ec62f7bf4b38@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90183","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Enhancement","color":"green","uses":139},{"id":"560b9120dd52582e17b54dc0","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Important","color":"yellow","uses":18}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/FPLsJKh4","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/FPLsJKh4/646-cw-ccw398-provide-a-way-to-capture-case-manually"}
