If the Upliftment Agent used the wrong barcode, and a divorce order went through to fast capture, there will still not be fields available for the divorce order, but only for maintenance order fields. If it was then captured and verified like that , it is not a dev issue, and they must rather look training the capturers and verifiers."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-09-03T05:52:20.096Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
