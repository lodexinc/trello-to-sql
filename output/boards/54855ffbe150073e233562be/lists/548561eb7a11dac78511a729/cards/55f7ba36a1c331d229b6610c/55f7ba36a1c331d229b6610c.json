We need to verify how much work was done by both Tebogo Dithipe and Fiona Klassen as judgement verifiers yesterday, Neil has also indicated that only 140 went out to the clients and the hourly verification report shows 880 verified by both verifiers yesterday. Please can this be investigated?\n\nLogged by Gordon","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"548561eb7a11dac78511a729","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":597,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["54855ffb74d650d567b90187"],"name":"CW - GCCW180 - Judgments verification report","pos":28242.5,"shortLink":"qHIeW74w","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":12,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+55f7ba36a1c331d229b6610c+82c3ecc3871d1d9b2bdc25fe817f08ae17d7e22e@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90187","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Issue / Bug","color":"blue","uses":206}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/qHIeW74w","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/qHIeW74w/597-cw-gccw180-judgments-verification-report"}
