The reason I put this on here early is so we don\u0027t have to rush this.\n\nPlease just get a clean copy of SearchWorks running. Clear all search history, users, companies, billing and create 1 company called Index360 in ClientCentral with a couple of our internal users.\n\nDisable all the search types except for the Maintenance Order searches.\n\nYou can use the following URL\u0027s:\n\nui.index360.co.za\nwcf.index360.co.za\nbilling.index360.co.za\nclients.index360.co.za\n\nThen, everywhere it states SearchWorks we have to replace with Index 360.\n\nJust ask @johnfrier to setup those URL\u0027s on our UAT, or DEV, or any other server he feels would be fine for the first phase.\n\nThanks guys.\n\n@willemhuman @yasserogier @lylenutt @cobuspienaar @stefanbar ","card":{"id":"55e44ea04e5f67dc779921aa","name":"I360 - New System","idShort":557,"shortLink":"hxMGiUsX"},"board":{"id":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Cape Town - 2015","shortLink":"nkiN4mz2"},"list":{"id":"548561db38fd879b2bc329e5","name":"Pending Tasks"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-09-07T04:23:49.757Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3","avatarHash":"f303f406818d7519d91c3c089e1c27a8","fullName":"Jako van Rensburg","initials":"JR","username":"jakovanrensburg"}}
