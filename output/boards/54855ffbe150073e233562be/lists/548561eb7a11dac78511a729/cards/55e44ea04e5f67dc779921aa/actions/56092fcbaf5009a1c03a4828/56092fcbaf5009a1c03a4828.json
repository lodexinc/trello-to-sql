The formula would be adding the percentage of the amount each year for every year since the case was granted.\n\nFor example:\nIf the original amount was R1000 in 2013 with a 10% escalation, it would be R1000 + 10% for 2014 and R1100 + 10% in 2015 (R1210).\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-09-28T12:17:15.102Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
