OTP via SMS or email, as well as google authenticate are all valid second factor systems. I would think an API would need another type of authentication method, as long as the system using the API can identify itself securely, usually by presenting some sort of strictly managed key and identity management system or federation service. The system calling the API should use two factor authentication though."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-09-17T07:38:56.044Z","memberCreator":{"id":"5510029ff388d0ebdf4ccd68","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Marthinus Pretorius","initials":"MP","username":"marthinuspretorius"}}
