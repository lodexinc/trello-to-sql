Automatic Verify on Capturer Match\n2. Manual Verify by the Verifier\n\nRecently i have changed the history wording on the Verifier method from \"Case Verified\" to \"Case Verified - Admin\" so that both sprocs have unique history.\n\nI have now noticed that when Tebogo receives her \"404\" then the old history is being written to the DB. Which means that the \"Capturer Verify\" method is being called at that time instead of the \"Verifier Verify\" method.\n\nPlease perform an investigation regarding the validation for which Verified method gets called in the system.\n\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca50d","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":460,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["54855ffb74d650d567b90187"],"name":"CW - Tebogo Verify Issue","pos":73728,"shortLink":"nzNztIhv","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":4,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+55a74bc2b7bf94b510e551a5+d916d5267b5d21316b274a06a78483ded343bcf2@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["53d097f91cb25024461e3efd"],"labels":[{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90187","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Issue / Bug","color":"blue","uses":206}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/nzNztIhv","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/nzNztIhv/460-cw-tebogo-verify-issue"}
