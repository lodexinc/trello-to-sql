Can you get someone to complete the capturing of those two cases and then log out? After that is done, will I only be able to assign the case, so they need to let me know. Also remind them that they shouldn\u0027t click to get the next case after the two cases are completed."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-08-24T07:05:55.768Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d0f06e86ebecc388380ce0","avatarHash":"","fullName":"Lyle Nutt","initials":"LN","username":"lylenutt"}}
