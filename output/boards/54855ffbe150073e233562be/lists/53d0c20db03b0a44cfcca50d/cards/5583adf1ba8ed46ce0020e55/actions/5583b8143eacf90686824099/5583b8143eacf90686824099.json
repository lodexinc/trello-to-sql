If you look in the folders there are tons of images sitting there.\nThe agents are trained to take the barcode photos in the correct orientation so if they do not do so, their work will not be sorted and they wont be paid.\n\nIf we want to move to QR barcode in the future then we can test that on UAT before taking it live.\n\nBased on the amount of work needed to manually sort and the fact that the amount of images is growing every day, I feel we should go back to the old component until proper testing can be done on the new one/move to QR codes. Unless there is a way to use both components. If one fails, try the other.\n\nThanks."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-06-19T06:35:00.296Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
