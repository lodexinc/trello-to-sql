It seems that the autosorter cannot read the barcodes. The jump is massive and we have now had to hire a resource to sit and manually sort all day at a cost. Even so, we are not getting through all the work. This is now impacting our finances, stats and reporting to management.\n\nPrior to adding maintenance and divorce orders to the auto sorter we had no issues with manual sorting as the barcodes were being read and the images leftover were in the 10s. Now the images left behind are in the 1000s.\n\nPlease this be looked into and please can we make sure that the same components are being used to read the barcodes.\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca50d","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":384,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["54855ffb74d650d567b90187","548561a179d5c1de96ba5276"],"name":"CW - CCW326 - Autosorter issue","pos":3358719,"shortLink":"DPDXHg86","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":4,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+5583adf1ba8ed46ce0020e55+793e880798338a6f65634a79244382b5659f19cb@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d"],"labels":[{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90187","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Issue / Bug","color":"blue","uses":206},{"id":"548561a179d5c1de96ba5276","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Urgent","color":"orange","uses":199}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/DPDXHg86","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/DPDXHg86/384-cw-ccw326-autosorter-issue"}
