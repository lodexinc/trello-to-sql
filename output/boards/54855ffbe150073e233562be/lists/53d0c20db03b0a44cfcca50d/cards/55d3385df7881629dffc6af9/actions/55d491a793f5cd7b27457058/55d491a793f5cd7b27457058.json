We cannot afford anymore hiccups on this system. Please can we give this priority and all hands on deck especially senior dev. Please prepare solutions scenarios for discussion or even better find a solution and fix it. In simple terms the penalties that will be imposed on us should we not meet the MBOD deadline is the entire profit from the project and more.
