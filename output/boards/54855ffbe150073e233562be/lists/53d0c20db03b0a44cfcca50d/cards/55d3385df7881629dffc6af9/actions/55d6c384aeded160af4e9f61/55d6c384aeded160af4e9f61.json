I just spoke to Gordon. This sounds like an internet or network related issue at the JHB office. He confirmed that there is no problems at any of the capturers outside the office. There where also no speed issues yesterday from the office, which makes me further suspect that the speed issues there was on Wednesday was maybe also network related. @johnfrier could you maybe please speak to Shaun or check from this side if you guys can see anything. Thanks"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-08-21T06:21:56.653Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
