I am unable to determine the slow speed at the moment as itâ€™s not the userâ€™s internet speed, nor is it the servers the application is running on and it cannot be code that worked fine before 3 pm yesterday. I tested a scenario on DEV and UAT environments, and the speed was with 2 â€“ 8 seconds to complete the tasks. Is it all the users complaining about this or just a handful? Unfortunately I cannot test this on LIVE system.\n\nRemember the systems has had a lot of additional elements added which means there are more things to process now.\n\n@gillianoberholzer @neilbosworth @yasserogier @willemhuman @johnfrier \n@jakovanrensburg ","card":{"id":"55d3385df7881629dffc6af9","name":"CW - GCCW163 - System speed","idShort":526,"shortLink":"Cc6p9nj2"},"board":{"id":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Cape Town - 2015","shortLink":"nkiN4mz2"},"list":{"id":"548561db38fd879b2bc329e5","name":"Pending Tasks"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-08-19T13:22:47.753Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbd67fd63aac7f152189c","avatarHash":"c4073941033c6263ed206ed19771873b","fullName":"Stefan Bar","initials":"SB","username":"stefanbar"}}
