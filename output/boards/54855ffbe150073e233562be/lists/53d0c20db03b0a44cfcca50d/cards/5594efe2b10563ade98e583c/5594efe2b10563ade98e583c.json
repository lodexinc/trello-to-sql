To add a bit of excitement maybe let them know as well they will pick a number and will receive whatever prize is behind there IT COULD ALSO BE    THAT THEY CHOOSE A NUMBER WHICH STATES BOTH PRIZES IS WON (i.e. they do not need to pick which one in that category they want as per excel sheet). It will be nice as well, if it is put on to the site for the clients to see on Facebook, adds hype.\n\n2.\tIn addition to that there can be a spot prize any day of the week too whoever bridges in that week i.e. the R250 Woolworths voucher/debit card voucher either or up to you guys.\n\n3.\tThen the final day of the month â€œChristmas in Julyâ€ whoever did the most applications application whichever you guys prefer will win the major prize, i.e. the Le Creuset Hamper.\n\n4.\tI think the R500 and R250 new user should be kept going as well and therefore can say over R10 000 worth of prizes to be won or bumper of a month whichever slogan you guys would like.\n\n","descData":null,"idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","idList":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca50d","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":422,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["548561a179d5c1de96ba5276","54855ffb74d650d567b90183"],"name":"SW - Bridging competition","pos":17280,"shortLink":"bxTVhKij","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":8,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+5594efe2b10563ade98e583c+6bfee9336c35805263dab67c5c8117027d31df3c@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["53d097f91cb25024461e3efd"],"labels":[{"id":"548561a179d5c1de96ba5276","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Urgent","color":"orange","uses":199},{"id":"54855ffb74d650d567b90183","idBoard":"54855ffbe150073e233562be","name":"Enhancement","color":"green","uses":139}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/bxTVhKij","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/bxTVhKij/422-sw-bridging-competition"}
