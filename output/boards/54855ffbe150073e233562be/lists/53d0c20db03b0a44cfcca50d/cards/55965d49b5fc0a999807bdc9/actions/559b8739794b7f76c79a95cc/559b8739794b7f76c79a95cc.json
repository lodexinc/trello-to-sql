The dev guys must please look into the underlying issue causing the images to be not found.\n\nIf it happens on capturing, the system automatically places it on hold. If it happens on verifying, it has to be logged and it slows down production a lot. It would be great if they could look at what is causing the image not to move and resolve that. Alternatively, a solution where the system checks each case as it is sorted, captured or verified to see if the images exist may be an option."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-07-07T08:00:57.631Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Gillian Oberholzer","initials":"GO","username":"gillianoberholzer"}}
