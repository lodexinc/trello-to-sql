Apologies, I misunderstood the actual issue here. The issue is indeed with the data going to the bureaus, but not from our system. \n\nBrief History:\nBrenden wrote a webservice that we imported into the Daily Extract application. This service supplied us with Admin Order data on a daily basis, which was sent, together with the judgments info, in one file, to the bureaus. This service stopped working on 20-06-2014. Brenden was supposed to fix this for us, but he never did, and if I am not mistaken, he left the company a month later. We need to get access to that service, fix it, and then reimport into daily extract and deliver the data to the bureaus. \"There is an option in there to grab the data for a specified date as well. e.g. from beginning to end of month\" @willemhuman can you please ask John, to maybe get hold of Sakkie, I will also skype you his details. He will have to either give us that code, or give us access to the server to fix the code on that side, so that we can implement and get the data out. \n\nIf something is unclear, please let me know, I will reply as soon as I get the chance, but I have spoken to neil, so he should also be able to explain if this isn\u0027t clear. \n\nThanks guys."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-01-23T05:13:05.263Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
