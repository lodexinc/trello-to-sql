That data was never supplied to us from Credit. @yasserogier, could you please look in the DB or our extract sprocs, what would have caused the 30 other records to go out to Compuscan please, or at least, why did the other Bureaus not receive the data. \n\nRegarding the data from Credit. They never switched off the FTP side of things on their side. I am not sure if TU for example ever received data from them. If they didn\u0027t we supplied them with Admin Orders from Credit Side, up until the Service Brenden wrote crashed. They should however still receive all Admin Orders captured on our side, within Courtworks. Thus, like the scenario above, the 31 records. The converstation I had with Brenden at that stage when their service stopped working, was that the Burueas would still continue to get the data from them, I just have no idea which bureaus all received data from them in the first place."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-01-23T04:53:40.935Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
