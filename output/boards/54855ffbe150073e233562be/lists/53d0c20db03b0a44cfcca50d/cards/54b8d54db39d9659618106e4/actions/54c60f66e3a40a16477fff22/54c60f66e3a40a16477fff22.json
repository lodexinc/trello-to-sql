Is the code you are referring to formatted like LPCC178905? If so, that is the unique ref ID of the LAWACA system. If the data is being imported into our own DB before being extracted to the bureaus, I can only assume that it gets an ID from our side. This is fine, however, we will need to be able to link the two IDs on our side in the background for auditing purposes."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-01-26T09:56:54.094Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
