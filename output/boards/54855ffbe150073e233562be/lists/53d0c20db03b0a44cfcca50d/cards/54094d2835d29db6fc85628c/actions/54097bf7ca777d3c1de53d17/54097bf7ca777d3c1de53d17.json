I\u0027ve enabled the Quick Search for some multi\u0027s also, excluding Properties and Documents since we don\u0027t have enough information yet to perform the search.\n\n2. The tabs will now hide if there are no options available in the list.\n\n3. Fixed a Trust bug as well where CSI Trust searches were not building as an option to DO Trust results.","card":{"id":"54094d2835d29db6fc85628c","name":"SW - Redesign the Quick Search","idShort":171,"shortLink":"dASvqmjV"},"board":{"name":"Cape Town - 2015","id":"54855ffbe150073e233562be"},"list":{"id":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca50d","name":"In Testing (Max 10)"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-09-05T09:01:43.146Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3","avatarHash":"f303f406818d7519d91c3c089e1c27a8","fullName":"Jako van Rensburg","initials":"JR","username":"jakovanrensburg"}}
