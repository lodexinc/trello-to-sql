The application needs to be installed to be integrated with windows.\n\nIt has always been on live. Yes we know that we should not put things to live as it might have bugs, but since the previous version that was on live already completely never worked. This solved that as well.\n\n@gillianoberholzer @cobuspienaar"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-03-09T08:40:22.705Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbeeeee76c37272350cdf","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Nicolas","initials":"NT","username":"nicolastyler"}}
