I think something did not create, or insert into the DB. That is why the login is not working, it\u0027s not able to get all the information of the application required. All I can think. The others work, so this one should too.... @gillianoberholzer maybe delete it and re-create using the information supplied, re-assign and see if it works. @lylenutt "},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-08-25T08:35:33.914Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3","avatarHash":"f303f406818d7519d91c3c089e1c27a8","fullName":"Jako van Rensburg","initials":"JR","username":"jakovanrensburg"}}
