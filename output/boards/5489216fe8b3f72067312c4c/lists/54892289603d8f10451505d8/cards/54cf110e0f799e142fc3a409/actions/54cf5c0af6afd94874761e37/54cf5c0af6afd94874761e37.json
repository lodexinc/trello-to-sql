The Netherlands have a fully operational eCadastre system, so in that country you would need to assess what the capabilities are and which of those eCadastre systems have API\u0027s. Where no API\u0027s exist, then we\u0027d need to assess if there are third parties in the country that we could integrate with.\n\nHowever for countries like Namibia that are still \"paper based\", the Deeds verification component would not need to function for that district. \nSo this functionality should be something that could be toggled on and off depending on if we need it in that country."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2015-02-02T11:14:18.754Z","memberCreator":{"id":"501aa133272c83603421fa00","avatarHash":"d0bb5359118aaf7363e755b196a9882a","fullName":"Pierre Aurel","initials":"PA","username":"pierreaurel"}}
