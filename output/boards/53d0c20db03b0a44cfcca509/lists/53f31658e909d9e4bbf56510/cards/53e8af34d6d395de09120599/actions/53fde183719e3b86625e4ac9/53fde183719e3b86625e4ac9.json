I can confirm that the below record returns an image on the Webservice. \n\nPlease note. If you do verify any other records on UAT, and you want to make them available to Inoxico, you will have to notify us, as we have to do a manual import over to the extraction db, as these records usually only become available to the clients after extract. \n\nPlease check the admin login again as well, should be working now"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-27T13:47:47.954Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
