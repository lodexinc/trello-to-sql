If you look at the demand letters i\u0027ve mailed to you, the addresses which contain the postal code are longer than that which dont. Also on the screenshot that Brenda sent, one of the demand letters contain a fullstop at the postal code (also a shorter address), and on frontend you cant use fullstops or text, only numbers. @jakovanrensburg"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-10-31T09:56:13.132Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Gillian Oberholzer","initials":"GO","username":"gillianoberholzer"}}
