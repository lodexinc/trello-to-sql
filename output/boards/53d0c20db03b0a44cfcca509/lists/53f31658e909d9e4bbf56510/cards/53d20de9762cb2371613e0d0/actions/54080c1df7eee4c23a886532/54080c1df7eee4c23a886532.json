If they select No, they will need to select a reason as per below and then still have the option to upload images as they need to supply a court stamped form stating the reason for the images not being available.\n\nThese reasons would then need to be kept for reporting purposes.\n\nAny other questions, let me know."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-09-04T06:52:13.714Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
