The rest are on report central already.\n\nWhat this report is for, is to see if a case verified on attorneys CourtWorks matches a case on capturing CourtWorks and whether it was verified before or after the case on capturing CourtWorks. I also need to see how many cases captured on attorney CourtWorks are not matched to cases on capturing CourtWorks.\n\nEssentially this is to see if attorney CourtWorks is really contributing or not."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-13T13:12:03.133Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
