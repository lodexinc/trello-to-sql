Re: search feature: Please allow to search on last name, first name, username and email address. \n2. If this is done, then with the ALL A B C, etc add #. \n3. At search for, add a Clear and Search button.\n4. Number of Records: for example, if I click on letter A to search on, there are only 8 records, can you show the number of records for this too and not only when the records go over to another page.\n6. If I have to ask the account holder their security question, can this not automatically pop up when clicking Edit User. That will then be the first thing they do and will prevent them forgetting to ask. \n7. Please change the wording in Personal Details to: Please ensure the information below is correct as this might affect communication between the relevant parties. \n6. Please change wording in Security Question of user: Please verify the account holder by asking the following security question.\n8. If I sometimes log in the Search bar on top pertaining to ALL A B C, displays on side running down. Please see screenshot\n\n@stefanbar","card":{"id":"53ec44a4ec4b8d891cc2fd5c","name":"VW - Client management","idShort":112,"shortLink":"WB0WFilc"},"board":{"id":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca509","name":"Cape Town - Kanban","shortLink":"0GuDZG62"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-15T12:24:06.586Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Gillian Oberholzer","initials":"GO","username":"gillianoberholzer"}}
