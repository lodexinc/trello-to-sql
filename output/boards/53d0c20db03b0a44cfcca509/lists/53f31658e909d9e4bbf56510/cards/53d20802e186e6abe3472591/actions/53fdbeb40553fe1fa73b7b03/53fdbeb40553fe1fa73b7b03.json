I have sorted a couple of images on there, no DR\u0027s though. If you do happen to sort more images or DR\u0027s into the system, please notify us once done, so that we can run the bulk importer, as there is no AutoSorting system running on UAT, which actually inserts the record."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-27T11:19:16.011Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
