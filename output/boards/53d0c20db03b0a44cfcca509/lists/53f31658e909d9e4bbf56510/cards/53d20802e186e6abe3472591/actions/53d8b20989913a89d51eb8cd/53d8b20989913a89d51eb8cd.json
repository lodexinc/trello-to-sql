It should show that the case was returned by a verifier and the reason it was returned by a verifier. i.e. This case was returned by a verifier as it had too many errors. Please recapture the case.\n\nThe verifier should have reasons for returning a case or possibly a text box where they can type a reason."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-07-30T08:51:21.851Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d2098c5dc4ef2c4b37773d","avatarHash":"cf33be632f5da9e22f4c332f7ece1542","fullName":"Neil Bosworth","initials":"NB","username":"neilbosworth"}}
