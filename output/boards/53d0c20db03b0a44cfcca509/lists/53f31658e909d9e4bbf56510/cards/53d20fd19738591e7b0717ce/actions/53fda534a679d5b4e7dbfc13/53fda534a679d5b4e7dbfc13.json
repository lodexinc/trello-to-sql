If so, it should pop up a window and state the the case has been previously captured and provide details of the case. At this point the user should have the option of placing the current case on hold or continue to capture it.\n\nIf they place it on hold, then it should be given a specific reason called \u0027Capturer On Hold Duplicate\u0027 so that they can be reference at a later stage.\n\nThe reason they have the option to continue is because they may get a rescission and the previous case was the judgment.
