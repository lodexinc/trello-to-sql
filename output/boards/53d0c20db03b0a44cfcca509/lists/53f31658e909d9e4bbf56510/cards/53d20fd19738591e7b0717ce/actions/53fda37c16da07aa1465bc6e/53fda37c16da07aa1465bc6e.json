I just want a bit of clarity on this issue. When we show the capturer the window stating that the Case has already been verified, and we provide them with the option to continue capturing? Will this not sort of make this null and void? Also, what will happen with the cases that they choose not to recapture? We can cancel them, without any problem, but I would then recommend that there is a section somewhere in Admin where these cases can be viewed to see if it was rather a capturer issue etc."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-08-27T09:23:08.396Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfbbfb4c2831b3f1b4bffb","avatarHash":"ec2557f35d26598c8a21e2802c04f5c6","fullName":"Cobus Pienaar","initials":"CP","username":"cobuspienaar"}}
