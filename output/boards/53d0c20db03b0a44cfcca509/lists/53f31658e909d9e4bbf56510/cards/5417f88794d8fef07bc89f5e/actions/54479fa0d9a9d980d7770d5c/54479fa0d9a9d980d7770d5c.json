As discussed previously, the Referrer is to be used as the Sales Person which is how it was spec\u0027d previously.\n\nPlease also note that we created a Report for Chantelle in Report Central that checks for companies without Sales Persons and she assigns them for Commission purposes.\n\nPlease communicate this change with Chantelle as well please.\nPlease don\u0027t make a hasty decision with this change until all parties understand the current process and what will be affected if changed as requested in the checklist above.\n\n@lungisaximbi"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-10-22T12:14:24.057Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53cfc3dbf80a9a2e4631c72c","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Yasser Ogier","initials":"YO","username":"yasserogier"}}
