Point no 3. Seems there was a misunderstanding. When 3rd line of an address is left blank, the postal code must move up on to that line in CC. This will be required in all address fields in CC. \n\nAlso note, in Branch Details fields where address pulls through, it has 2 blank spaces after the comma instead of one. \ne.g. 10 Main Road,  Boston,  Bellville\n(new and old companies)"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-11-07T07:31:00.412Z","memberCreator":{"id":"53d097f91cb25024461e3efd","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Gillian Oberholzer","initials":"GO","username":"gillianoberholzer"}}
