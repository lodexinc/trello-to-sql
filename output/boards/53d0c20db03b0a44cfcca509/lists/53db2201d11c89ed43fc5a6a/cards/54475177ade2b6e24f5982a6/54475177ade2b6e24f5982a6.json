All data was completed and merged to both documentation sets (attached).\n\nOnce the status reached â€œAwaiting Credit Approvalâ€ which is straight after the Agent logged in with their temp details and uploaded both sign documentation, some of the details â€œdisappearedâ€. I am not sure how this happened and cannot really investigate this being a live application. \n\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca509","idList":"53db2201d11c89ed43fc5a6a","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":286,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["5465641074d650d5671f9594"],"name":"SW - EA model blank fields","pos":4096,"shortLink":"v0wmvO8h","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":3,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"jakovanrensburg+53cfbb55f833a01546975bd3+54475177ade2b6e24f5982a6+0a99a5ea9e18ddebd04d27234b5ab7b824a56213@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"5465641074d650d5671f9594","idBoard":"53d0c20db03b0a44cfcca509","name":"Issue / Bug","color":"blue","uses":78}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/v0wmvO8h","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/v0wmvO8h/286-sw-ea-model-blank-fields"}
